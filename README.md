# Random Training

> Create a simple Workout and the exercises will be shuffled

Workouts will be structured like this:
- workout plan 1
    - training block 1 (for example warm-up)
        - exercise 1
        - exercise 2
        ...
    - training block 2 (for example main training)
    ...
- workout plan 2
...

Then the exercises from each training block will be chosen at random.
